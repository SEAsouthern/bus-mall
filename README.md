# bus-mall
A lab project for week 3.

This webpage is to be used to gather consumer preferences for products. It randomly presents 3 different products for the user to choose from. It records the choices made and presents the data after 25 choices have been made. 

User Stories:

As a marketer, I want to see the results, so that I can pick the most popular products. 

As a developer, I want clean code so that I can modify and add to the survey.

As a focus group, I want clear instructions so I can know what I'm doing.
